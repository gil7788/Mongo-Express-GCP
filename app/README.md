# Mongo Express Typescript

This project is a MongoDB and Express.js application implemented in TypeScript. It uses Git for version control and Yarn as the package manager. This setup is designed for modern web application development with a focus on type safety and efficient data handling with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database.

## Setup
### Git
To set up your project with version control using Git:

1. Create a new directory for your project: `mkdir <project-dirname>`
2. Change into your project directory: `cd <project-dirname>`
3. Initialize a new Git repository: `git init`
4. Create an empty Git repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab
5. Add the remote repository URL to your local repository: `git remote add origin <repository clone url>`

### Yarn - Package Manager
To set up Yarn as your package manager:

- Download and install Yarn from [Yarn Installation Guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Ensure you are in your project directory: `cd <project-dirpath>`
- Initialize your project with Yarn: `yarn init -y`

## Usage

### Install Yarn Dependencies
- To install all the project dependencies defined in your `package.json`, run: `yarn install`

### Run the Application
- Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: `yarn build`
- Start your Express application using Yarn: `yarn start`

## Test
To run TypeScript tests for your application, use the following command:
- `yarn test`

## Suggested Development Tools
### Postman
Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy to create, share, test, and document APIs. It offers a straightforward user interface for sending HTTP requests and viewing responses.
